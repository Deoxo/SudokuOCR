<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## Introduction üóíÔ∏è

### What is it ?

This Sudoku OCR is a C++ program which detects and solves Sudokus in images. Provided with an input image containing a Sudoku, the program pre-processes the image, locates the Sudoku, extracts and isolates it, recognizes the digits present in the grid, and eventually compute the ouzzle solution.<br>
This project was originally made in C, as a school group project during my sutdies at EPITA. I then switched the whole project to C++ before adding/improving features. I also changed the GUI lib used, from GTK3 to Qt6.<br>

#### Credits

The vast majority of the code has been written by me, though some parts are still the same as when my group submitted our project to EPITA. As a result, you may find some code of √âvrard Casamayou, Flaurian Baudron or  Math√©o Chahwan.

### Creation process
The digit recognition part is taken from the  [Neurocore Deep Learning library](https://github.com/Aur3lienH/Neurocore) that I write with a friend. I already had some experience with Qt for the GUI. The image-preprocessing and grid detection have been the real challenges here. I implemented it with the help of the develpper's best friend: Google.

## Installation üî®

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the following packages, using `sudo apt install package_name`:
- **build-essential**
- **cmake**
- **qt6-base-dev**
- **qt6-base-dev-tools**
- **qt6-tools-dev**
- **qt6-l10n-tools**


### Build

This step assumes you fulfilled all the requirements aforementioned.

Run the following commands:
```sh
cd ~/Desktop
cd SudokuOCR-main
mkdir cmake-build-release
cd cmake-build-release
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target SudokuOCR
cd ..

```

### Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

```sh
./cmake-build-release/SudokuOCR
```
Then simply follow the instructions displayed. Sample Sudoku images are available in the `Images`folder.
